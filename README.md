# Spreading-Resistance-Estimation-Tool-for-Heat-Spreader-Design
MATLAB tool for thermal engineers to estimate spreading resistance (R_sp) using Simons' 2004 model. Generates R_sp vs area plots for various spreader thicknesses. Helps evaluate design tradeoffs early without simulations by inputting source size, material, and geometry.
